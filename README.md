## 💭 Architectural Wisdom

> "Good architecture is like a good constitution – it enables growth while maintaining order."
>
> "I've seen technologies come and go, but fundamental principles endure. Focus on principles, not just tools."
>
> "The best system is one that becomes invisible – it just works, scales, and evolves."
>
> "After 30 years, I still learn every day. The day you stop learning is the day you become obsolete."
